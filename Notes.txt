Python Setup
Using anaconda Distribution for Python
1.Anaconda Install python and easy to use in Development Environment.
2.Briefly run Jupyter Notebook.

 Using Online interpreter for Python
 1.Online Jupyter Notebook
 2. Google colab niotebook
 
 Using CMD
 Using IDE (Pycharm,Spyder)

Python Object and Data Structure Basics
A. Introduction to Python Data Types
1.Text Type:	    str
2.Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
3.Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
4.Mapping Type:	    dict
5.Set Types:	    set, frozenset
6.Boolean Type:	    bool
7.Binary Types:	    bytes, bytearray, memoryview

B. Python Numbers
1.There are three numeric types in Python:
int  Eg. x = 1    # int
float Eg. y = 2.8  # float
complex eg. z = 1j   # complex

C. Python Variables
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

D.Introduction to Strings
Strings are sequences of characters using the strings either a single quote or double quote.
eg. 'hello' is the same as "hello".

Python - Slicing Strings
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

String Concatenation: Using + to concatinate strings

E.Python Booleans
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

F.Python Dictionaries
Dictionaries are used to store data values in 'key:value pairs.'

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.

Unordered: When we say that dictionaries are unordered, it means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

Changeable: Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

Duplicates Not Allowed: Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

D.Python Tuples
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

E.Python For Loops

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

G.Python If Else Conditions

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

H.Python While Loops
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

Python has two primitive loop commands:
while loops
for loops
